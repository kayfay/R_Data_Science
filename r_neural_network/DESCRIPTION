Description:
    Objectives: To examine the inner-workings of a deep neural network,
        to design DNN algorithm that can perform pattern recognition and learning tasks.
    Data source: Data sources can be any event, variables, i.e. an X matrix,
        and outcome, class, i.e. y vector, based data set.
    Type of statistical framework: The frame work will be a deep neural network
        based on computational mathematics.
    Data format: The parameters passed can be any row by column matrix of
        X corresponding to a y vector.
